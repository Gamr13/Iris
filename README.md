# Iris
Iris is a multipurpose discord bot created to serve a variety of functions. 

How to set Iris up:
1) Download the repository
2) Open the config.json file
3) Create a new bot on the Discord Developer Portal
4) On line 6 (Bot Admins) Place the ID(s) of people you wish to be able to control the bots settings. 
5) Place your bot token on line 12 in the quotation marks.
6) Open CMD or Terminal in the bots folder and run ->    node index

Future features?
In the future I plan on adding the following features:
   - Allow for multiple pings for the fun commands (i.e hug two people rather than one at a time)
   - Add more fun games to play
   - Allow for mod log configuration
   - Allow for non-pings in fun commands (i.e !hug toby rather than !hug @toby)
   - Add more fun commands
   - Allow for the bot to send images from the server rather than having to use imgur links -- optimisation.
